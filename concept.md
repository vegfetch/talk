# Live Example: How do I git?
## What is git?
Git is a command line interface application. It was created by Linus Thorvalds in 2004 as an open source replacement for BitLocker. _todo Check this again_
## Let's get started
Install git, depending on your OS and shell preferences.
Create a new repo on github.
Click the "clone or download" link, copy the url.
Open your shell.
Navigate to the parent folder in which you want your project folder to be.
do

    git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git

This will add the contents of the repository and the changes that have been made to a new folder. Now you can start coding and making changes.

    git add file.name
    git commit -m "first commit"
    git push
