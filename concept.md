# What is a Version Control System?
A version control (or revision control or source control) is a means to organize the production of large bodies of text. This can include for example program code, legal documents or a company's technical documentation. Version Control offers several features like restoration of previous versions(the undo button in word processors), collaboration of several authors, or tracking of changes.

# Why should I use Source Control?
- You see what others have changed
- You can roll back mistakes
- Your code is saved often
- \+1 on your Joel Test score ;)

## What is git?
Git is a command line interface application. It was created by Linus Thorvalds in 2005 as an open source replacement for BitKeeper.
## Let's get started
# Hands-on hacking
Install git, depending on your OS and shell preferences.
Create a new repo on github.
Click the "clone or download" link, copy the url.
Open your shell.
Navigate to the parent folder in which you want your project folder to be.
do

    git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git

This will add the contents of the repository and the changes that have been made to a new folder. Now you can start coding and making changes.

    git add file.name
    git commit -m "first commit"
    git push

## Octocat Picture
Important. No git talk without Octocat.
